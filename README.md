# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey
Introduction
The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results.

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here(opens in a new tab).

Here is an overview of the main steps in this project, following the CRISP-DM process:

Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Evaluate your results.
Share your insights with stakeholders in a blog post.
We will explain further details about these steps in the following pages.
