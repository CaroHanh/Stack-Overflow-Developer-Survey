#Project Overview
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results.

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here(opens in a new tab).

Here is an overview of the main steps in this project, following the CRISP-DM process:

Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
Evaluate your results.
Share your insights with stakeholders in a blog post.
We will explain further details about these steps in the following pages.

# Project Dataset Options
## Data
For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from Airbnb available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey(opens in a new tab)
You might have different questions about the 2017 StackOverflow survey data than I looked at earlier in the course. If you choose this dataset, you cannot use the same questions that were analyzed earlier in the classroom.

Alternatively, if you felt pretty confident with the techniques in this lesson, you might be looking to push the envelope. In this case, you may choose to retrieve all of the Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years(opens in a new tab) results. From this data, you could analyze trends over time. What languages were most popular each year? What other changes can you observe over time?

# Project Steps and Instructions
## Key Steps for the Project
Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.

Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

Prepare data:
Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize
Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them
Communicate your business insights:
Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
Project Deliverables
There are two deliverables that are required for project completion.

A Github repository for your code.
A blog post of your findings.
Your Github repository must have the following contents:

A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.
Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.
For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report(opens in a new tab) on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post. Your blog** **must provide the following:

A clear and engaging title and image.
Your questions of interest.
Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
Note: The post should not dive into technical details or difficulties of the analysis; this should be saved for Github. The post should be understandable for non-technical people from many fields.
